# ViewRush: Instant Document Viewer

![ViewRush Logo](viewrush-logo-128.png)  
**Quickly open documents and media files in your browser with a right-click or local upload.**

ViewRush is a Chrome extension that lets you view a wide range of file types—documents (e.g., `.docx`, `.pdf`), spreadsheets (e.g., `.xlsx`), presentations (e.g., `.pptx`), images (e.g., `.png`), audio (e.g., `.mp3`), and video (e.g., `.mp4`)—directly in your browser. Right-click links or elements like buttons on webpages, or upload local files via the popup, and ViewRush handles the rest.

## Features
- **Right-Click Viewing**: Open supported files from webpage links or buttons using the context menu ("Open Document in Browser").
- **Local File Upload**: Drag and drop or browse local files in the popup to view them instantly.
- **Wide Format Support**: Works with `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, `.png`, `.mp3`, `.mp4`, and more via services like Microsoft Office Online and Google Docs Viewer.
- **Privacy-Friendly**: Local files like PDFs and images open via blob URLs; others upload temporarily to tmpfiles.org (deleted after 60 minutes).

2. Right-click it and select **"Open Document in Browser"**.
